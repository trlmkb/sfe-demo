Storybook is an open source tool for developing UI components in
isolation for React, Vue, and Angular. It makes building stunning UIs
organized and efficient.

## Update Storybook
Write your own component stories by creating [componentName].stories.jsx files.
I.e. if you have component named Component1.jsx, then your stories file will be
